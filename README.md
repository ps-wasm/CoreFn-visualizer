# CoreFn-visualizer

This is a very limited CoreFn declaration visualizer. It is meant to help reasoning about CoreFn structures in the research for my bachelor's thesis.
Only a limited number of declarations and / or a limited tree depth is supported.

#### Acknowledgements
- I used the example found [here](https://codepen.io/katzkode/pen/ZegQQB) code to start building a vertical tree D3 tree.
- I used the example found [here](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/7555321) to create my own `wrap` function that wraps the labels of namespaced identifiers.
