# CoreFn-visualizer

This is a very limited CoreFn declaration visualizer. It is meant to help reasoning about CoreFn structures in the research for my bachelor's thesis.
Only a limited number of declarations and / or a limited tree depth is supported.

#### Acknowledgements
I used code to start building a vertical tree D3 tree found [here](https://codepen.io/katzkode/pen/ZegQQB). Besides that, I used the example used to create multiline node text is found [here](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/7555321) to build my own `wrap` function that wraps namespaced identifiers.
