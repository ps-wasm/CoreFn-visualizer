# CoreFn-visualizer

This is a very limited CoreFn declaration visualizer. It is meant to help reasoning about CoreFn structures in the research for my bachelor's thesis.
Only a limited number of declarations and / or a limited tree depth is supported.

Code used to start building D3 tree can be found [here](https://codepen.io/katzkode/pen/ZegQQB). Besides, an example used to create multiline node (with the `wrap` function) text is found [here](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/7555321)
